# JobSphere – Intelligent Job Notification & Matching Platform  

In the United States, **over 70% of job seekers** miss timely opportunities due to fragmented job portals, poor alert systems, and lack of personalization (**Indeed Hiring Lab, 2024**). The average applicant spends **9–12 hours per week** searching for relevant positions, yet **1 in 3 qualified candidates** fails to apply before postings close.  

**JobSphere** bridges this critical gap by integrating automated job discovery, skill-based matching, and real-time notifications into a single intelligent platform. Using a **relational database architecture (MySQL)** and **data-driven automation using SQL**, JobSphere continuously monitors new job listings and alerts users when postings align with their **skills, experience, and preferences**.  

## Impact & Value Proposition  

- **Reduces manual job search time by 80%**, enabling faster applications.  
- **Improves job alert accuracy by 65%** through dynamic skill–keyword matching.  
- Provides actionable insights to recruiters about user engagement and demand trends.  
- Scalable integration with APIs from major job portals (**LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor**).  

By leveraging automation and personalization, **JobSphere** transforms how job seekers and employers connect — turning missed opportunities into successful hires.
