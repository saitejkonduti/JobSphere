# JobSphere ‚Äì Intelligent Job Notification & Matching Platform  

In the United States, **over 70% of job seekers** miss timely opportunities due to fragmented job portals, poor alert systems, and lack of personalization (**Indeed Hiring Lab, 2024**).

Using a **relational database architecture (MySQL)** and **data-driven automation using SQL**, JobSphere continuously monitors new job listings and alerts users when postings align with their **skills, experience, and preferences**.
